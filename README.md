# Kmeans_FaceRecognition


## Important !!

If you want to know more about that project please read my article [Face Recognition using K-means clustering]() where I discussed the Idea behind face recognition using K-means clustering algorithm !!!

## Prerequisites

In order to exploit that project you'll need data of faces that you want to recognize, that's why I invite you to check my project of face detection and recognition where I provided the source code of Face detectiona nd recognition using Dlib libraries and also a data extractor that you'll help you to get face data [Face Detection and recognition](https://github.com/yasser1dev/FaceRecognition).

Also you'll need to donwload and install the following python packages :

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* SickitLearn
* Pandas
* Mysql Connector
